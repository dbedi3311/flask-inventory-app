# Flask-Based Inventory Tracking Application

This is an inventory application built with Flask, SQLite, and Semantic UI to help track hypothetical inventory for a company. Submission for the Shopify Backend Developer Challenge 2022


## Deployed
I've hosted the inventory application on Heroku at the following link: [https://flask-inventory-app.herokuapp.com/](https://flask-inventory-app.herokuapp.com/) 

CRUD functionality (Creating new inventory, Reading inventory items in list format, Updating inventory, and Deleting inventory) has been implemented. An additional feature is the ability to export the stored inventory into a .csv file (which can be done by clicking the download button).
